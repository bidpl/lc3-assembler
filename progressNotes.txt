Wrote function declaration for parseOperands
Added support for .BLKW in parseInstr

Finished these instructions:
(1 operand opcodes all done)
-JMP
-JSR
-JSRR
-TRAP
-BR
(2 operand opcodes)
-LD
-ST
-LDI

Big TODOs:
Figure out how to write to binary files

symbolTable:
-.STRINGZ and .BLKW support

finishparseInstr
-.STRINGZ support
-Check parseOperands return code (so imm range checking works)


finish parseOperands
-finish parseOperands


Notes:
I don't really check fot ZEXT/SEXT, might break stuff, might not
